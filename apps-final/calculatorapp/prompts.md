# Prompt for creating the calculator app
I want to Build a Calculator app : Command Line App : It should accepts two numbers and perform the calculation.
- User should be given asked to provide the operation they would like to perform : add, substract, multiplication, division
- Exit option to exit from the calculation.
- Once the calculation is completed then ask for more operation to perform.

Technical Choices:

Use the concepts thats been learned so far :
- Classes, methods
- Scanner for receiving inputs.
- Control Structures - If, else if, switch, while , ternary
- Do not use collections , Streams, Lamdas yet.

Generate the code for me under the calculator app module
