## Vehicle Polymorphism in Java

This file demonstrates polymorphism using a vehicle system. The base class `Vehicle` is extended by `Car` and `Bike`, each adding or overriding behaviors to model real-world vehicle features.

## Prompts for Replication

### Prompt 1: Vehicle and Car
**Task**: Create a base class `Vehicle` and a subclass `Car` that overrides the `start()` method to add car-specific logic.

**Expected Function Signature**: `class Vehicle`, `class Car extends Vehicle`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "Vehicle/Car Polymorphism Demo"
- Show vehicle starting and car-specific logic in `start()`

### Prompt 2: Bike Subclass
**Task**: Create a subclass `Bike` that overrides the `start()` method to add bike-specific logic.

**Expected Function Signature**: `class Bike extends Vehicle`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "Bike Polymorphism Demo"
- Show bike-specific logic in `start()`
