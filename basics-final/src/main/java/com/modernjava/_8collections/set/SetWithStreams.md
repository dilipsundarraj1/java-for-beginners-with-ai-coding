# SetWithStreams.java - Advanced Set Operations with Java Streams

## Overview
This file demonstrates how to use the Java Streams API with Set collections for functional programming and data processing. It covers creating Sets from other collections, filtering, transforming, grouping, and advanced operations using Streams. These examples help you leverage the power of Streams to work with Sets in a concise and expressive way.

## Prompts for Replication

### Prompt 1: Creating Sets from Collections Using Streams
**Task**: Create a method that demonstrates building Sets from Lists and mapping elements using Streams.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void createSetsFromStreams()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "1. Creating Sets from Streams:"
- Create a List of fruits with duplicates
- Use Streams to collect unique fruits into a Set
- Use Streams to map fruit names to their lengths and collect into a Set
- Print results
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 2: Filtering Sets with Streams
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating how to filter Set elements using Streams.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void filteringSets()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "2. Filtering Sets:"
- Create a Set of colors
- Use Streams to filter colors by length and starting letter
- Print results
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 3: Transforming Sets with Streams
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating how to transform Set elements using Streams.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void transformingSets()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "3. Transforming Sets:"
- Create a Set of animal names
- Use Streams to transform names to uppercase and to their lengths
- Print results
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 4: Grouping Data into Sets with Streams
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating how to group elements into Sets using Streams.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void groupingIntoSets()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "4. Grouping Data into Sets:"
- Create a List of names
- Use Streams to group names by their first letter into Sets
- Print results
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 5: Advanced Set Operations with Streams
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating advanced Set operations using Streams, such as partitioning and finding min/max.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void advancedSetOperations()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "5. Advanced Set Operations:"
- Create a Set of numbers
- Use Streams to partition numbers into even and odd Sets
- Use Streams to find the max and min values in the Set
- Print results
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Creating Sets from Collections
- Use Streams to collect unique elements from Lists
- Map elements to new values and collect into Sets

### 2. Filtering and Transforming Sets
- Use Streams to filter elements based on conditions
- Transform elements (e.g., to uppercase, to lengths) using map()

### 3. Grouping and Partitioning with Streams
- Group elements by a property into Sets using groupingBy()
- Partition elements into Sets using partitioningBy()

### 4. Finding Min/Max in Sets
- Use Streams to find the minimum and maximum values in a Set

**Code Examples:**
```java
// Collecting unique elements from a list
Set<String> uniqueFruits = fruits.stream().collect(Collectors.toSet());

// Filtering elements
Set<String> longColors = colors.stream().filter(c -> c.length() > 4).collect(Collectors.toSet());

// Transforming elements
Set<String> upperAnimals = animals.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).collect(Collectors.toSet());

// Grouping by first letter
Map<Character, Set<String>> grouped = names.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(n -> n.charAt(0), Collectors.toSet()));

// Partitioning even/odd
Map<Boolean, Set<Integer>> partitioned = numbers.stream().collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(n -> n % 2 == 0, Collectors.toSet()));

// Finding min/max
int max = numbers.stream().max(Integer::compareTo).orElse(-1);
int min = numbers.stream().min(Integer::compareTo).orElse(-1);
```
