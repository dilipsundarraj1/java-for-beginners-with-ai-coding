# SetBasics.java - Understanding Set Fundamentals in Java

## Overview
This file introduces the fundamental concepts of Set in Java using simple examples. It demonstrates basic Set operations including creation, adding, membership checking, and removing elements. Sets are essential collections that store unique elements, making them ideal for membership tests and removing duplicates. This serves as a foundation for understanding Set usage before progressing to advanced operations.

## Prompts for Replication

### Prompt 1: Basic Set Operations - Creating and Using Simple Sets
**Task**: Create a method that demonstrates creating Sets and performing basic operations like add, contains, and size.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void basicSetOperations()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "1. Basic Set Operations:"
- Create `Set<String> fruits = new HashSet<>();`
- Add elements: "apple", "banana", "orange", and a duplicate "apple"
- Print the complete set showing all elements
- Check if an element exists using `contains("banana")`
- Display set size using `size()`
- Add blank line at end for spacing

### Prompt 2: Different Types of Sets and Their Characteristics
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet with their ordering behaviors.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void differentSetTypes()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "2. Different Types of Sets:"
- Create HashSet with animals: "cat", "dog", "bird"
- Print HashSet with note "(no order)" showing unpredictable ordering
- Create LinkedHashSet with same animals in same order
- Print LinkedHashSet with note "(insertion order)" showing maintained order
- Create TreeSet with same animals in same order
- Print TreeSet with note "(sorted order)" showing alphabetical sorting
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 3: Common Set Operations Every Developer Should Know
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating essential Set operations like remove, addAll, and clear.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void commonSetOperations()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "3. Common Set Operations:"
- Create numbers set with 1, 2, 3
- Remove an element using `remove(2)`
- Print set after removal
- Add multiple elements using `addAll(Arrays.asList(3, 4, 5))` (demonstrates ignoring duplicates)
- Print set after addAll
- Clear the set using `clear()`
- Print set after clear
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 4: Set Iteration Techniques - Different Ways to Loop Through Sets
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating two different approaches to iterate through Set elements.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void setIterationExamples()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "4. Set Iteration Techniques:"
- Create colors set with "red", "green", "blue"
- Demonstrate enhanced for loop:
  - Print "Using enhanced for loop:"
  - Loop through set and print each color
- Demonstrate forEach() with lambda:
  - Print "Using forEach() with lambda:"
  - Use `forEach(c -> ...)` to print each color
- Add blank line at end for spacing

---

### Prompt 5: Real-World Examples to Help Understand Set Usage
**Task**: Create a method demonstrating practical Set applications including removing duplicates and membership tests.

**Expected Function Signature**: `public static void realWorldExamples()`

**Requirements**:
- Print section header: "5. Real-World Set Examples:"
- Create example for removing duplicates:
  - List with duplicates: "Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie", "Bob"
  - Create Set from list and print unique names
- Create example for membership test:
  - Set of allowed users: "admin", "user", "guest"
  - Check if a user (e.g., "user") is allowed and print result
- Add blank line at end for spacing

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Set Creation and Basic Operations

**What you'll learn:**
- How to create different types of Sets (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)
- Basic operations: add(), contains(), size(), remove(), addAll(), clear()
- Understanding uniqueness constraint and membership testing
- When to use Set interface vs concrete implementations

**Code Examples:**
```java
// Creating a Set
Set<String> fruits = new HashSet<>();

// Adding elements
fruits.add("apple");
fruits.add("banana");

// Checking membership
if (fruits.contains("banana")) {
    System.out.println("Banana is present!");
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Sets do not allow duplicate elements
- add() ignores duplicates
- contains() checks for membership
- size() returns the number of unique elements

### 2. Different Set Types and Their Ordering

**What you'll learn:**
- HashSet: No guaranteed order, fastest performance
- LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order
- TreeSet: Automatically sorted by elements
- When to choose each Set implementation
