# MovieRecord.java - Converting Traditional Class to Modern Java Record

## Overview
This file demonstrates the transformation of a traditional Java class (MovieV2) into a modern Java Record. Records, introduced in Java 14, provide a concise way to create immutable data classes with automatic generation of constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods. This transformation showcases how to modernize legacy code while maintaining the same functionality with significantly less boilerplate code.

## Prompt for Replication

### Task: Transform MovieV2 Class to MovieRecord
**Objective**: Convert the existing MovieV2 class into a modern Java Record while preserving all validation logic and functionality.

**Expected Class Signature**: 
```java
public record MovieRecord(
    String title,
    int duration,
    MovieGenreEnum genre,
    double rating,
    int minimumAge,
    String streamingPlatform
) { /* implementation */ }
```

**Requirements**:

#### 1. Record Declaration and Components
- Convert the class declaration from `public class MovieV2` to `public record MovieRecord`
- Define record components matching the private fields from MovieV2:
  - `String title` - movie title
  - `int duration` - duration in minutes  
  - `MovieGenreEnum genre` - movie genre using enum
  - `double rating` - rating out of 10.0
  - `int minimumAge` - minimum age requirement
  - `String streamingPlatform` - streaming platform name
- Add appropriate comments for each component explaining their purpose

#### 2. Compact Constructor with Validation
- Implement a compact constructor (without parameter list) that performs validation
- Add debug output: `System.out.println("Parameterized constructor called");`
- Apply the same validation logic as MovieV2 setters:
  - **title**: Set to "Unknown" if null, otherwise keep as-is
  - **duration**: Use `Math.max(0, duration)` to ensure non-negative
  - **genre**: Set to `MovieGenreEnum.DRAMA` if null, otherwise keep as-is  
  - **rating**: Use `Math.max(0.0, Math.min(10.0, rating))` to clamp between 0.0 and 10.0
  - **minimumAge**: Use `Math.max(0, minimumAge)` to ensure non-negative
  - **streamingPlatform**: Set to "Unknown" if null, otherwise keep as-is

#### 3. Instance Methods Migration
- **formattedDuration()**: Copy the no-parameter method exactly from MovieV2
  - Calculate hours and minutes from duration
  - Call the overloaded method with calculated values
- **formattedDuration(int hours, int minutes)**: Copy the overloaded method exactly from MovieV2
  - Build formatted string with hours and minutes
  - Return format: "2h 30m" or just "30m" if no hours

#### 4. Immutability Helper Methods
Since records are immutable, add "with" methods to create new instances with modified values:
- **withRating(double newRating)**: Return new MovieRecord with updated rating
- **withStreamingPlatform(String newPlatform)**: Return new MovieRecord with updated platform
- Both methods should create new instances using the record constructor

#### 5. Documentation and Comments
- Add comprehensive class-level JavaDoc explaining:
  - This is MovieV3 implemented as a record
  - Records provide immutability and automatic method generation
  - Validation is performed in the compact constructor
- Include inline comments explaining the validation logic
- Document the transformation from mutable class to immutable record

#### 6. Methods NOT to Include
Do NOT migrate these methods from MovieV2 (they're automatically provided by records):
- Getter methods (getTitle(), getDuration(), etc.) - records auto-generate accessors
- equals() method - records auto-generate based on all components
- toString() method - records auto-generate (though you can override if needed)
- hashCode() method - records auto-generate based on all components
- printMovie() methods - these are display methods, not core data operations
- trimTitle() static methods - these are utility methods, keep in MovieUtils if needed
- displayMovie() method - this is a demonstration method

#### 7. Key Transformation Points
- **From mutable to immutable**: No setters, use "with" methods instead
- **From explicit constructors to compact constructor**: Single constructor with validation
- **From private fields to public components**: Record components are implicitly public
- **From manual equals/hashCode to automatic**: Records generate these based on all components
- **From verbose getter methods to simple accessors**: `title()` instead of `getTitle()`

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Java Records Introduction
**What Records Provide:**
- Immutable data classes by default
- Automatic generation of constructor, accessors, equals(), hashCode(), toString()
- Significant reduction in boilerplate code
- Enhanced readability and maintainability

**Record Components vs Class Fields:**
```java
// Traditional class
private String title;
public String getTitle() { return title; }

// Record
public record MovieRecord(String title, ...) { }
// Automatically provides: title() accessor method
```

### 2. Compact Constructor Pattern
**Traditional Constructor:**
```java
public MovieV2(String title, int duration, ...) {
    setTitle(title);
    setDuration(duration);
    // ... validation in setters
}
```

**Compact Constructor:**
```java
public MovieRecord {
    // Direct field assignment with validation
    title = (title == null) ? "Unknown" : title;
    duration = Math.max(0, duration);
    // ... validation inline
}
```

### 3. Immutability and "With" Methods
Since records are immutable, provide methods to create modified copies:
```java
public MovieRecord withRating(double newRating) {
    return new MovieRecord(title, duration, genre, newRating, minimumAge, streamingPlatform);
}
```

### 4. Automatic Method Generation
Records automatically provide:
- **Accessors**: `title()`, `duration()`, `genre()`, etc.
- **equals()**: Based on all components
- **hashCode()**: Based on all components  
- **toString()**: Formatted representation of all components

## Benefits of Record Transformation

### 1. Code Reduction
- **MovieV2**: ~200 lines with getters, setters, equals, toString
- **MovieRecord**: ~60 lines with same functionality
- Elimination of repetitive boilerplate code

### 2. Immutability by Default
- Thread-safe without synchronization
- Prevents accidental modifications
- Encourages functional programming patterns

### 3. Automatic Method Consistency
- equals() and hashCode() always match
- toString() includes all components automatically
- No risk of forgetting to update methods when adding fields

### 4. Enhanced Readability
- Clear separation between data and behavior
- Component declarations serve as documentation
- Reduced cognitive load when reading code

## Usage Comparison

### Creating Instances
```java
// MovieV2 - mutable
MovieV2 movie = new MovieV2("Inception", 148, THRILLER, 8.8, 13, "Netflix");
movie.setRating(9.0); // Can be modified

// MovieRecord - immutable  
MovieRecord movie = new MovieRecord("Inception", 148, THRILLER, 8.8, 13, "Netflix");
MovieRecord updated = movie.withRating(9.0); // Creates new instance
```

### Accessing Data
```java
// MovieV2 - traditional getters
String title = movie.getTitle();
int duration = movie.getDuration();

// MovieRecord - component accessors
String title = movie.title();
int duration = movie.duration();
```

## Best Practices for Record Design

1. **Use Records for Data Classes**: Perfect for DTOs, value objects, and configuration classes
2. **Validate in Compact Constructor**: Perform all validation and normalization
3. **Provide "With" Methods**: Enable immutable updates for common modifications
4. **Keep Business Logic Separate**: Records for data, services for complex operations
5. **Document Component Contracts**: Clear JavaDoc for validation rules and constraints

## When to Use Records vs Classes

### Use Records When:
- Primary purpose is to hold data
- Immutability is desired or required
- Minimal business logic beyond accessors
- Need equals/hashCode based on all fields
- Want to reduce boilerplate code

### Use Classes When:
- Need mutable state
- Complex inheritance hierarchies required
- Extensive business logic within the entity
- Need fine-grained control over equals/hashCode
- Require multiple constructors with different behaviors

## Migration Strategy from Class to Record

1. **Identify Data-Only Classes**: Look for classes with mostly getters/setters
2. **Extract Business Logic**: Move complex operations to service classes
3. **Convert Field by Field**: Transform private fields to record components
4. **Consolidate Validation**: Move setter validation to compact constructor
5. **Replace Mutators**: Create "with" methods for necessary modifications
6. **Update Client Code**: Change getter calls and instantiation patterns
7. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure equals/hashCode behavior matches expectations

This transformation demonstrates how modern Java features can significantly simplify code while maintaining functionality and improving design quality.
