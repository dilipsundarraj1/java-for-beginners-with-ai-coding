# Java Installation  

### [Java Installation Steps](https://github.com/dilipsundarraj1/java-installation)


# Prompt to Create Content for Whole Topic 
- I need help with creating content that covers about Regex, String Tokenizers.
- Generate code for that and break it down by simple examples and a source file per lecture.
- Generate some real-world examples too.
- Create a package named _7regex and place source code under that. 
- Create the markdown file as similar to ArrayBasics.md for each source file.

# Prompt to Create Content for Lectures

I am creating a next lecture that covers this topic : TextBlocks in Java".
Can you give slide content , voice script in detailed form as like explaining to beginners ?
- Please ensure the voice script covers whats in the slide.
Please generate the lecture title also. Can you for that for me ?
